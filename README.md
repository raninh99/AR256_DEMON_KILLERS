The problem is to

1-Artificial Intelligence based solution for predicting future price trend of cotton

2-Suggesting a suitable pricing model.

3-Maintaining the bridge between buyers and sellers.

# Solution-

1-Developing a highly interactive Bi-lingual userâ€™s interface for showing the future market price trend of cotton.

2-Predicting day-wise and month-wise price trend for next one year of major market places (both tabular and in the form of graph) of cotton in India.

3-Best price of cotton in your city from all market places of cotton in your desirable month.

#Technology Stack

*For client side
-React.js with bootstrap and axios for data transfer

*For server side
-Django (a framework of python) and MongoDB as our database

*Machine Learning Models
-Non-Linear Random Forest Regression model for day wise future trend.
-Arima model for full year trend

Factors considered in ML Model:

*In Non-Linear Random Forest Regression Model
Yield 
Area Sown
Inflation Rate
Date 
Month

*In Arima Model
Time based analysis done here on available past year data.

# Our End Users

1.Farmers
They can easily get an idea when to sell their surplus at what rate.
 
 *What would be their net price including all taxes and transportation cost in some other city or state 

2.Industrialists.

*Easily compute their net profit 

*Develop their marketing strategy for the next commercial year i.e. when and from where to buy their raw materials.

# How our model is working

1.Our Random forest model is able to discover more complex dependencies. 

2.It is the sum of piecewise function and has regularization inbuilt.

3.In our time-series analysis model(arima), we are minimizing irregularity by implementing operations like logscale and exponential weighted moving average.

4.Our model is giving RSS value around 0.32 and p value around 0.002 which is quite appreciable.

5.We are getting an order of (1,1,1) for our arima model

# Conclusion

1.This with the help of our web-application one can see the future trend of cotton in major market places of cotton in the nation, both day-wise and month-wise trend for the next one year.

2. For both buyers and for sellers we are increasing market place area by getting them know about the future cost of cotton at their door-step.

3.Our interaction user-interface will fascinate the user as well.
